# Gene Network Analysis
## Introduction

High-throughput experimental data, such as that obtained from sequencing technologies, often yields long lists of genes, which can be difficult to interpret without further analysis. Gene network analysis offers a framework for understanding how genes interact with each other, enabling the identification of critical genes, pathways, and interactions in biological systems. By constructing gene networks, we can uncover the relationships between genes, identify hubs or key regulators, and explore how groups of genes may coordinate to drive biological processes.

In this chapter, we will discuss methods for constructing gene networks from sequencing data, the different types of networks used in biology, and how to interpret them.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand what gene network analysis is and its role in interpreting complex gene expression data.
- Learn the different types of gene networks and how they can be constructed.
- Perform basic gene network analysis using Python and other bioinformatics tools.

## What is Gene Network Analysis?
Gene network analysis involves creating models that represent the relationships between genes based on their co-expression patterns, physical interactions, or shared pathways. These networks are graph-based structures where:

- Nodes represent genes
- Edges represent interactions, such as co-expression or regulatory interactions.

Gene networks allow researchers to:

- Identify key regulators (hubs) that control large parts of the network.
- Discover clusters of genes that work together in specific biological processes.
- Predict the function of uncharacterised genes based on their position in the network.

## Types of Gene Networks

1. Co-expression Networks: These are built by identifying genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across different conditions or samples. Highly correlated genes are likely to be functionally related or co-regulated.

2. Regulatory Networks: These networks focus on transcription factors and their target genes, illustrating the control and regulation of gene expression.

## Constructing Gene Networks

Gene networks are typically constructed using computational tools that process gene expression data. Some common steps include:

- Data Input: Use a list of differentially expressed genes or a full gene expression matrix from RNA-sequencing data.
- Correlation Calculation: For co-expression networks, calculate the correlation between gene pairs to determine if they are co-regulated.
- Thresholding: Apply a threshold to define significant correlations or interactions.
- Network Visualisation: Use tools like Cytoscape or NetworkX to visualize and analyse the resulting network.

## Gene Network Analysis Tools

- WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis): A popular tool for building co-expression networks from RNA-seq data.
- Cytoscape: A tool for visualising and analysing biological networks.
By performing gene network analysis, you can identify biologically meaningful patterns and relationships that may not be apparent from simple gene expression lists.

## Practical Steps for Gene Network Analysis

1. Data Preparation: Start with a gene expression matrix or a list of differentially expressed genes.
2. Choose a Network Construction Method: Select the appropriate type of network based on the research question.
3. Visualise the Network: Use visualisation tools to explore the structure and relationships in the network.
4. Interpret the Network: Identify key nodes (genes) and clusters that may represent critical pathways or regulatory hubs.
